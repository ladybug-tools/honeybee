	Compute bin numbers corresponding to Tregenza sky discretization

	The Tregenza sky uses 145 patches, with patch 1 pointing due
	North at the horizon, and continuing around to the East to
	patch 30, which comprises the first altitude row (alt = 6 degrees).
	Each successive row increases altitude by 12 degrees, with the
	final altitude at the zenith (90 degrees).  Azimuth is evenly
	divided among 30, 30, 24, 24, 18, 12, 6, and 1 divisions per row.

	In addition to the bin numbers 1-145 corresponding to this
	standard, bin 0 is used for the ground plane (altitude < 0).

	Input is normalized ray direction (Dx,Dy,Dz).  The Y-axis is
	assumed to point North, and the X-axis East, matching the
	convention set by gensky(1).
