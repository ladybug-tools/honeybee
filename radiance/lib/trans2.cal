	These formulas compute the index of refraction and
	normal transmission for a pane of glass given the
	measured normal transmittance and reflectance values,
	Tn and Rn, respectively.

	These formulas are approximate -- the exact solution
	involves a quartic equation and seemed more trouble
	than it was worth.  If you know the index of refraction,
	you are better off with the formula in trans.cal.
