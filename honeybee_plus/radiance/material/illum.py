    Illum is used for secondary light sources with broad distributions. A secondary light
    source is treated like any other light source, except when viewed directly. It then
    acts like it is made of a different material (indicated by the string argument), or
    becomes invisible (if no string argument is given, or the argument is "void").
    Secondary sources are useful when modeling windows or brightly illuminated surfaces.
